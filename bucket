BUCKET


It was in the item list which was given to us during admission. One had to bring items during hostel allotment
for daily use. It was like backpack for travel but it was long one. Torch, mug, nailcutter, slipper, handkercheif, 
oil, comb and so
many other things were explicitely mentioned in the list. For the first few days we chained the bucket with the 
bed. A boy of age 11yrs was given the responsibility of keeping the key of box and chain safe. He had an idea. He
 took a nylon thread attached the key in it and wear it on neck. A good move so far. For a minute, you are reluctant to
take care of your bucket and it's gone. One had to solve the enigma to find it. Reason is simple and are many. There are so many
 in need but not have their own. seniors does not posses the bucket of their own. The guidelines are given during 
admission only. The peculiar relationship with bucket. They were usually kicked like football for no reason at all.
The probability of using personal bucket after six month comes down to zero. To be on the safer side of having one 
when inspection were carried out by house master we tried to buy a bucket with unique design and comparatively
tougher than the previous ones. To some extent steel bucket stayed longer with his owner. I had to dedicate one 
chapter to bucket as it was used for other purposes as well which may no be used outside that mad world. used as
stumps for cricket.
