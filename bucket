BUCKET


It was in the item list which was given to us during admission. One had to bring items during hostel allotment
for daily use. It was like backpack for travel. Torch, mug, nailcutter, slipper, handkercheif, oil, comb and so
many other things were explicitely mentioned in the list. For the first few days we chained the bucket with the
bed.
